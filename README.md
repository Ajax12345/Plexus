# Plexus: Online Role Playing Strategy Games for Sociology

Plexus is a browser- based, realtime multiplayer game that allows students to engage in virtual collective action, such as protest. The foundation of the game is a two-actor model, where each player is randomly assigned to one of two roles, for example, as either a protestor or a police officer. In each round, players communicate with their team members and choose a move to make in response to a reaction from their opponent. Per the gameâ€™s payoff matrix, points are awarded based on which move each side makes in a round.

Gameplay features include realtime player action updates, integrated chat, and the inclusion of instructor-provided educational content at key points in the game. Instructors can create customizable gameplay content, game payoff matrices, and post-game statistics graphs.
