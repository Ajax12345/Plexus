    "text":"This is a game to teach students about protest. When used in a classroom setting, half of the students are assigned the role of the police, and the other half to the protestors. During each round of the game, the students will be presented with two possible choices, to act non-violently or violently.  The protestors will begin the game. The most common reaction chosen by the players of the side is compared to the opponent side's collective move, and points are awarded, using a payoff matrix. <br><br> In this demo version, you will play either on the side of the protestors or the police, and the computer will be your opponent.",
